<h>Testing Framework</h>
The chosen testing framework, pytest, which can be activated by the CI/CD pipeline once a pull activity is being requested. The testing workflows can be configured inside GitHub Actions. Multiple workflows can be set up here to test each unit, module, or frontend feature. When a pull request, GitHub Actions will give the tester a warning; also, the pulling process will be paused until all the pytest checks are completed and passed. If any test failed, the tester could see a detailed report on the Checks page under Pull Requests to find the location of the bug or the reason why the testing failed. Once all the checks are marked pass, the tester can then complete the merging activity.
